As you may have seen on the [componentization](https://superforms.rocks/</components>) page, quite a bit of boilerplate can add up for a form, and then we havenâ€™t even touched on the subject of accessibility.
Fortunately, the UI-component guru Hunter Johnston, aka [@huntabyte](https://superforms.rocks/<https:/twitter.com/huntabyte>), has done the community a great service with his library [Formsnap](https://superforms.rocks/<https:/www.formsnap.dev/>)! It not only simplifies how to put your forms into components, but also adds top-class accessibility with no effort.
This is the style you can expect when using Formsnap, compared to manually putting attributes on individual form fields:

```
<form method="POST" use:enhance>
 <Field {form} name="name">
  <Control let:attrs>
   <Label>Name</Label>
   <input {...attrs} bind:value={$formData.name} />
  </Control>
  <Description>Be sure to use your real name.</Description>
  <FieldErrors />
 </Field>
 <Field {form} name="email">
  <Control let:attrs>
   <Label>Email</Label>
   <input {...attrs} type="email" bind:value={$formData.email} />
  </Control>
  <Description>It's preferred that you use your company email.</Description>
  <FieldErrors />
 </Field>
 <Field {form} name="password">
  <Control let:attrs>
   <Label>Password</Label>
   <input {...attrs} type="password" bind:value={$formData.password} />
  </Control>
  <Description>Ensure the password is at least 10 characters.</Description>
  <FieldErrors />
 </Field>
</form>
```

If it suits you, please check out the [Formsnap](https://superforms.rocks/<https:/www.formsnap.dev/>) library, it is really nice! ðŸ’¥
