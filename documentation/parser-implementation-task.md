Instructions understood! Let me explain the task in more detail:
We're building a text correction system that allows teachers to mark up student essays. The system needs several core files to handle everything from data validation to state management. Here are the files we need to create:

src/lib/schemas/corrections.ts

This is our type foundation using Zod
Defines all our correction types, tags, and node structures
Used for runtime validation and TypeScript type inference
Exports type utilities for use across the application


src/lib/utils/parser/index.ts

Our main parser that converts marked-up text into nodes
Handles the {{type:tag:text}} syntax
Contains functions for tokenizing text and validating markers
Works alongside our schema types for type safety


src/lib/stores/editorStore.ts

Uses Svelte 5 runes for state management
Manages the document's current state and history
Provides actions for manipulating nodes (add, delete, update)
Handles undo/redo functionality
Exports the document in various formats (editing, printing)



The workflow between these files is important:

Text comes in (either from manual input or API)
Parser processes it using our markup syntax
Nodes are validated against our schema
Store manages these nodes and provides UI interactions
Parser can also convert nodes back to text for saving

Our markup syntax is consistent:
Copy{{type:tag:text}}
Where:

type is: add, delete, empty, or indent
tag is an optional grammar category (like verb-tense, preposition)
text is what's being added or removed

For example, correcting "I go store" becomes:
CopyI {{delete:verb-tense:go}}{{add:verb-tense:went}} {{add:preposition:to}} {{add:article:the}} store
Each correction node in our system will maintain:

The type of correction
The original text
The correction text (if applicable)
The grammatical reason for the correction (as a tag)
Position information
Any metadata needed for UI rendering
