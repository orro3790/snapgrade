### Summary 11:14 PM 2025.2.2

Here's a 3-paragraph technical briefing on the current project state:
The Snapgrade text editor project is implementing user authentication with Firebase, featuring server-side session management through cookies and client-side context management for user data. The core functionality currently includes a Sidebar component for navigation, authentication modals, and the main text editor. We've just implemented a context-based user state management system that bridges server-side authentication (hooks.server.ts) with client-side components.
Key modifications span across src/routes/+layout.svelte, src/lib/components/Sidebar.svelte, and src/lib/utils/context.ts. The layout component now initializes user context with server data before rendering child components, using Svelte 5's runes ($state, $derived, $effect) for reactivity. The authentication flow follows a pattern where hooks.server.ts validates session cookies, loads user data from Firestore, and passes it through the layout data function to be consumed by client components.
The primary blocker was a TypeError in Sidebar.svelte caused by attempting to destructure undefined context. The solution involved implementing proper context initialization in +layout.svelte and adding safe fallbacks in Sidebar.svelte's context consumption. Outstanding tasks include implementing proper error boundaries, handling edge cases in the authentication flow (session expiration, token refresh), and ensuring consistent type safety across the context system. The next immediate step is to implement proper error handling for failed context initialization and add loading states for authentication-dependent components.

Task Completed
The ClassManager modal component has been successfully implemented with the following features:

Component Structure:
ClassList.svelte (Column 1): Displays list of classes with real-time Firestore updates
ClassDetails.svelte (Column 2): Shows class details and student list
StudentDocuments.svelte (Column 3): Displays student documents
ClassForm.svelte: Handles class creation/editing
StudentForm.svelte: Handles student creation/editing
Integration Points:
Firebase/Firestore for real-time data
SuperForms for form validation and submission
Modal system for component display
Server-side actions for data management
Key Features:
Progressive disclosure pattern with three columns
Real-time updates using Firestore listeners
Form validation using Zod schemas
Accessibility compliance with ARIA attributes
Smooth transitions and animations
Error handling and loading states
To use the ClassManager:

Open the modal using: modalStore.open('classManager')
Create/edit classes using the first column
Manage students within a selected class using the second column
View student documents in the third column
The implementation follows all project requirements including Svelte 5 runes syntax, proper form handling, and accessibility standards.
