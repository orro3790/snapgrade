### Summary 11:14 PM 2025.2.2

Here's a 3-paragraph technical briefing on the current project state:
The Snapgrade text editor project is implementing user authentication with Firebase, featuring server-side session management through cookies and client-side context management for user data. The core functionality currently includes a Sidebar component for navigation, authentication modals, and the main text editor. We've just implemented a context-based user state management system that bridges server-side authentication (hooks.server.ts) with client-side components.
Key modifications span across src/routes/+layout.svelte, src/lib/components/Sidebar.svelte, and src/lib/utils/context.ts. The layout component now initializes user context with server data before rendering child components, using Svelte 5's runes ($state, $derived, $effect) for reactivity. The authentication flow follows a pattern where hooks.server.ts validates session cookies, loads user data from Firestore, and passes it through the layout data function to be consumed by client components.
The primary blocker was a TypeError in Sidebar.svelte caused by attempting to destructure undefined context. The solution involved implementing proper context initialization in +layout.svelte and adding safe fallbacks in Sidebar.svelte's context consumption. Outstanding tasks include implementing proper error boundaries, handling edge cases in the authentication flow (session expiration, token refresh), and ensuring consistent type safety across the context system. The next immediate step is to implement proper error handling for failed context initialization and add loading states for authentication-dependent components.
