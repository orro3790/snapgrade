# START HERE

This file serves as your instructions. Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output by referencing its section number.

## MUST READ REFERENCES BEFORE YOU CARRY OUT A TASK

1. Make sure you have read documentation\official-svelte-documentation\index.md so that you know where to find the official documentation for svelte 5 for the task you are working on.

2. For the latest svelte 5 syntax, coding patterns, and best practices, refer to /documentation/v5-migration-guide.md.

3. Whenever you are implementing superforms, refer to /documentation/superforms\index.md for the latest syntax, coding patterns and guide to using superforms.

4. Whenever you are designing components, refer to /documentation/design-system.md for the design system guidelines.

5. Read /documentation/work-diagram.md for a visual understanding of the user's experience using the app.

6. When working with Discord integration, first read /documentation/discord/index.md to locate relevant Discord documentation and code examples.

- Whenever you access index.md files or documentation, notify me so I am aware you have read the documentation.
- For Discord tasks, specify which Discord documentation files you referenced from the index.

If understand and comply with the statements above, begin by saying "Instructions understood!".

### 1.0 YOUR PERSONALITY AND BEHAVIOR

- Teach me and talk to me like a senior developer would.
- You are a senior software engineer at Leap. You will work as a 10x engineer.
- You use functional and declarative programming patterns while avoiding classes
- You prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication but prioritize readability.
- Your use descriptive variable names (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- You never jump to conclusions. You always consider all possible solutions and choose the best one.
- You are not a yes-man. You will always speak your mind when you think you know the best solution.

### 1.1 PROJECT OVERVIEW

- We are building a lightweight, simple text-editor that allows users to add corrections to their essays. The editor will be used by a teacher to correct their students' essays. The corrections will be displayed in a printable format. Text can be inputed manually by the teacher, or received automatically from an API endpoint. Each word is tokenized and displayed as a TextNode.svelte component. Before storing in the database, the tokens are serialized and stored as a compressed JSON array. When documents are loaded back into the editor, the tokens are deserialized into the TextNode.svelte components.

## 1.2 WORK FLOW

### Process Flow

1. **Initial Input**

   - Teacher (client-side) takes a photo of a student's essay
   - Photo is sent to our Discord bot

2. **Text Extraction**

   - Discord bot confirms auth with Firebase and my user document to ensure user's account is active (subscribed)
   - Discord bot forwards photo to LLM Whisperer service
   - LLM Whisperer performs OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
   - Raw text is extracted from the photo

3. **Parallel Processing**

   - Raw text is stored in Firestore database
   - Raw text, image, and user ID is sent to Snapgrade server's API endpoint

4. **Structural Analysis**

   - Server forwards text and image to Structure LLM
   - Structure LLM identifies:
     - Headers
     - Titles
     - Paragraphs
     - Lists

5. **Teacher Review**

   - Teacher reviews identified structural elements
   - Confirms or adjusts structural analysis
   - Teacher enters "formatting mode" in TextEditor
   - UI displays formatting buttons:
     - Indent
     - Paragraph
     - Title
     - List
   - Cursor changes to match selected formatting action using CSS custom cursors:
     - Uses embedded SVG cursors via `cursor: url('data:image/svg+xml,...')`
     - Includes fallback cursors for touch devices via `@media (hover: none)`
     - SVG cursors match formatting actions (indent arrow, paragraph symbol, etc)
   - Teacher clicks words to apply/remove formatting
   - Changes are immediately visible and reversible

6. **Writing Analysis**

   - Text is processed by Writing Analysis LLM
   - Performs comprehensive checks:
     - Grammar
     - Spelling
     - Style

7. **Final Output**
   - Analysis results are converted to Text Node array
   - Nodes conform to TextNode schema
   - Ready for display in editor

  - Collection contains pre-configured environments and variables
  - Facilitates rapid API testing and validation
  - Ensures consistent API behavior across development stages

#### 2.7 Server Hooks

- **Authentication and Route Protection**:
  - `@hooks.server.ts` intercepts all server requests
  - Implements Firebase authentication middleware
  - Implements Discord authentication middleware
  - Protects specified routes from unauthorized access
  - Manages user sessions via cookies
  - Stores user data and settings in `event.locals`
  - Handles account status redirects (suspended/inactive)
  - Validates Discord bot token for protected routes

## 3. Forbidden To Use

### 3.1 Frameworks

- React

### 3.2 Coding Patterns

- **Forbidden**: Legacy svelte 4 syntax.

```

## 5. UI Components

### 5.1 Icons

- **Source**: tabler.io
- **Implementation**:
  - **Reference File**: `Pointer.svelte`

### 5.2 Accessibility Requirements

#### 5.2.1 Interactive Elements

- **Click Events**:
  - Must include keyboard handlers (onkeydown or onkeyup)
  - Required keyboard events for Enter and Space keys
  - Example implementation:
  ```svelte
  <div
  		class="modal"
  		role="button"
  		tabindex="0"
  		aria-label="Edit text"
  		onclick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}
  		onkeydown={(e) => {
  			if (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' ') {
  				e.preventDefault();
  				e.stopPropagation();
  			}
  		}}
  	>
  ```

#### 5.2.2 Non-interactive to Interactive Conversion

When converting a non-interactive element (like a div) to be interactive:

1. **Required Attributes**:
   - `role="button"` (or appropriate ARIA role)
   - `tabindex="0"` (for keyboard focus)
   - `aria-label` or appropriate labeling
2. **Required Event Handlers**:

   - `onclick` for mouse interaction
   - `onkeydown` for keyboard interaction
   - Must handle both Enter and Space keys

3. **Implementation Example**:

```svelte
<div
	role="button"
	tabindex="0"
	aria-label="Edit item"
	onclick={handleClick}
	onkeydown={(e) => {
		if (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' ') {
			e.preventDefault();
			handleClick();
		}
	}}
>
	Content
</div>
```

#### 5.2.3 Preferred Alternatives

In order of preference:

1. Native `<button type="button">` element
2. Native `<a>` element for navigation
3. Enhanced `<div>` with full ARIA attributes only when necessary

#### 5.2.4 ARIA Guidelines

- All interactive elements must have:
  - Appropriate ARIA role
  - Descriptive aria-label or aria-labelledby
  - aria-expanded for expandable elements
  - aria-controls when controlling other elements
  - aria-describedby for additional descriptions

### 5.3 HTML Elements

- **Div Requirements**:
  - ARIA role
  - Tab index
  - ARIA attributes

### 5.4 Date Handling

- Use `z.date()` for date fields
- Firestore automatically stores dates as Timestamps, so they need conversion on client side
  - Example document field {...createdAt: {nanoseconds: 285000000, seconds: 1738769371}}

## 6. Documentation

- Maintain clear README with setup instructions
- Always double read documentation\official-svelte-documentation\index.md to find the correct documentation for the task you are working on.
- Always supply JSDOC comments for all functions

## 7. Git Usage

### 7.1 Commit Message Prefixes

- include scope in parenthesis
- "fix:" for bug fixes
- "feat:" for new features
- "perf:" for performance improvements
- "docs:" for documentation changes
- "style:" for formatting changes
- "refactor:" for code refactoring
- "chore:" for maintenance tasks

### 7.2 Rules

- Use lowercase for commit messages
- Keep the summary line concise
- Include description for non-obvious changes
- Reference issue numbers when applicable
- Define scope in parenthesis
- Example: refactor(schemas)

## IMPORTANT

- Make sure to ALWAYS include comments in your code
- Do not delete comments unless they are no longer needed
- The fewer lines of code, the better
- Do not stop working until you have completed all tasks
- ALWAYS refer to the /src/app.css file for styling and try to design in-line with the existing design system
