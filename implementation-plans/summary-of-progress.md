Let me verify we've completed everything from our implementation plan:

✅ Authentication Flow

verifyDiscordUser function
Status checking
Error handling
✅ Image Processing Pipeline

Attachment handling
LLM Whisperer integration
Processing status updates
✅ Document Session Flow

Session creation
Image processing
Status tracking
✅ User Communication

Status messages
Error handling
Direct messaging
✅ Gateway Integration

WebSocket management
Event handling
Reconnection logic
✅ Build Configuration

TypeScript config
Package scripts
Module resolution
All components follow:

Functional programming (section 1.0)
Schema-based types
Project structure (section 4.1)
Process flow (section 1.2)
The implementation is now complete and ready to use. The bot can be:

Built with npm run build
Started with npm start
Both with npm run dev
Would you like me to help with anything else?

Discord bot implementation is complete with the following structure:

Core Files:

auth.ts: Authentication functions
messageHandlers.ts: Message and attachment processing
events.ts: WebSocket and Gateway event handling
init.ts: Bot initialization and cleanup
start.ts: Entry point and process management
Configuration:

package.json: Build and run scripts
tsconfig.bot.json: TypeScript configuration
Removed redundant files:

snapbot.ts (class-based implementation)
schemas.ts (moved to lib/schemas)
handlers/* (class-based handlers)
The bot can be run with:
npm run dev

This implementation follows:

Functional programming patterns
Schema-based type safety
Proper error handling
Clean architecture
