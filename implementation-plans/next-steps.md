# Snapgrade To-Do List

## Current Phase
We have reached a phase in the app development where text can be uploaded visa Discord, arrives correctly in our DocumentBay component, and is loaded into the TextEditor component for pre-correction analysis. This phase is referred to as the "formatting phase". Here, the user must take steps to verify the accuracy of the text extraction and automatic formatting that was generated by the LLM (Claude's Sonnet 3.7). During this stage, the user can correct text while in formatting mode, without applying correction annotations in the process. They can also correct any formatting issues by creating/deleting line breaks and indents, and selecting/deselecting the title as necessary. During the text extraction process, LLMWhisperer provides a confidence score for text that it was unsure of during the extraction process. This information is passed to the LLM for closer inspection durings its structure and correctness analysis. 

## Formatting Phase
Using the confidence score values, I propose we implement a system whereby words under a particular confidence level are highlighted automatically to draw attention to them as needing human-verification. This can save the user the time of having to re-read the entire text carefully, intensely matching the extraction to the source text word-for-word.

### 4a. Correction Pattern Decisions

We need to decide on the correction patterns we want Claude to enforce.

### 4b. Feedback Structure Decisions

We will need to decide on the general feedback structure we want:
- Should we start with areas for improvement, then end on positives?
- Should we note the most pressing areas for improvement in terms of grammar?
- What writing feedback should we give regarding:
  - Style
  - Essay structure based on the kind of essay written (expository essay, creative narrative, process essay, etc.)
  - Formatting (indentations, title, writing along margins properly, etc.)
  - Paragraph elements (thesis, topic sentence, at least 5 sentences per paragraph)
  - Sentence structure
  - Effort
  - Penmanship
  - etc.

Every academy and every teacher will have their own expectations and grading criteria for the kind of writing that was assigned to the student, so the instructions prompt that is passed to Claude in this stage will have to be variable.

### 4c. Assignment Schema Component

We should make a component that allows users to create and manage "Assignment Schemas" (feel free to suggest the most appropriate name for this if you think a better one exists). Here, the user can provide inputs to help instruct Claude how to interpret the writing:
- What kind of essay it is (creative narrative, process essay, compare and contrast, etc.)
- What specific things to look for:
  - Paragraphs should be at least 5 sentences long
  - Paragraphs should have a topic sentence that includes the thesis
  - The thesis should be restated in the conclusion but not copied directly from the introduction
  - etc.

Additionally, we should allow users to view the correction patterns that Claude can apply and enable/disable them as they wish (too many visible corrections can really overwhelm students and discourage them). This lets users create rulesets that can be used to instruct Claude how to correct the essay.

We should still track these corrections for monitoring student progress, but simply allow the user to toggle their visibility in the editor somehow (maybe by adding some buttons to the "title-container" div - we should change the name to something else, like "toolbar", by the way).

When a document is sent to Claude for corrections, we should check that the user has selected a schema for the document in question so that Claude can carry out the corrections appropriately.

### 4d. TextNode Schema Update

- Implement the addition of a "footnote" type to the TextNode schema. This way, Claude can add footnotes to the document that correspond with a particular part of the text which we can designate by placing a number above the TextNode. Currently, the only way to place text over a node is by designating it as a "correction" type and supplying correction text, but that would apply correction node styling as well, which we don't want for footnotes.
- Since footnotes are part of the editing phase (not formatting phase), we should add footnote functionality to the EditModal.svelte component rather than the FormattingModal.svelte component.

## 5. Revised Implementation Plan

### 5.1. Activity Component Implementation

1. **Create Activity Component**:
   - Create a new component called `Activity.svelte` in the routes directory
   - Reuse functionality from DocumentSessionHistory and ProcessingStatusModal
   - Implement a tabbed interface to show both document history and processing status

2. **Update modalStore Schema**:
   - Add 'activity' to the modalTypeSchema enum in `src/lib/stores/modalStore.svelte.ts`
   - Update modalDataSchema to include sessionId parameter if needed

3. **Create Server Actions**:
   - Create a Zod schema for the activity data in `src/lib/schemas/activity.ts`
   - Implement server actions in `src/routes/+page.server.ts` using Superforms:
     ```typescript
     import { superValidate } from 'sveltekit-superforms/server';
     import { zod } from 'sveltekit-superforms/adapters';
     import { activitySchema } from '$lib/schemas/activity';
     import { fail } from '@sveltejs/kit';
     
     export const actions = {
       getActivity: async ({ request, locals }) => {
         const form = await superValidate(request, zod(activitySchema));
         if (!form.valid) return fail(400, { form });
         
         // Fetch activity data from the database
         // ...
         
         return { form };
       }
     };
     ```

4. **Update Sidebar Component**:
   - Add a new sidebar item for "Activity"
   - Implement click handler to open the activity modal

5. **Implement Activity Component**:
   - Use Superforms for form handling:
     ```typescript
     import { superForm } from 'sveltekit-superforms/client';
     
     const { form, errors, enhance } = superForm(data.form);
     ```
   - Add the tabbed interface for document history and processing status
   - Implement loading states and error handling

6. **Update Main Page Layout**:
   - Move KeyboardControls modal from +layout.svelte to +page.svelte
   - Add the Activity component to the main page layout
   - Conditionally render it based on modalStore state

7. **Remove Standalone Route**:
   - Once the modal implementation is working, remove the `/processing-status` route

### 5.2. ClassManager CRUD Implementation

1. **Create Schemas**:
   - Define Zod schemas for class and student data in their respective schema files
   - Ensure proper validation rules are in place

2. **Implement Server Actions**:
   - Create actions for class and student CRUD operations in +page.server.ts:
     ```typescript
     export const actions = {
       createClass: async ({ request }) => {
         const form = await superValidate(request, zod(classSchema));
         if (!form.valid) return fail(400, { form });
         
         // Create class in database
         // ...
         
         return { form };
       },
       updateClass: async ({ request }) => {
         // Similar implementation
       },
       deleteClass: async ({ request }) => {
         // Similar implementation
       },
       // Student actions
       // ...
     };
     ```

3. **Update ClassManager Component**:
   - Implement forms using Superforms
   - Add proper validation and error handling
   - Implement loading states for async operations

### 5.3. Text Formatting Implementation

1. **Title Centering**:
   - Implement functionality to center title nodes using alignment spacer nodes
   - Create a function to sandwich title nodes between two alignment spacer nodes

2. **Paragraph Indentation**:
   - Implement first paragraph indentation without adding a lineBreak
   - Implement new paragraph formatting with lineBreak and indent spacer nodes

3. **FormattingModal Enhancement**:
   - Update the FormattingModal component to include these formatting options
   - Implement commands for title formatting, paragraph indentation, and other formatting options

### 5.4. TextNode Schema Update

1. **Schema Update**:
   - Add 'footnote' to the nodeTypeEnum in `src/lib/schemas/textNode.ts`
