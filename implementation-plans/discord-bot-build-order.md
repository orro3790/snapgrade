Based on my review of the existing Discord bot code, I've created a logical implementation plan that starts with the basics and builds up to more complex features:

## Implementation Plan - Logical Order

### Phase 1: Basic Image Reception and Verification (1-2 days)
1. Modify the bot to accept multiple images in a single message
2. Create a simple test script to verify image reception
3. Test with real Discord interactions

### Phase 2: Document Session Management (2-3 days)
1. Implement interactive message components (buttons)
2. Create session start/continue/end functionality
3. Update the image handling to work with document sessions

### Phase 3: Interaction Handling (2-3 days)
1. Create handlers for button interactions
2. Implement slash commands for manual control
3. Add error handling and recovery

### Phase 4: Document Organization (3-4 days)
1. Implement class and student selection after document completion
2. Create metadata association with documents
3. Build the Document Bay UI for post-processing

### Phase 5: Batch Processing (2-3 days)
1. Implement parallel processing for multiple documents
2. Add progress tracking and notifications
3. Optimize for classroom conditions

This approach ensures we verify each component works before building on it. I recommend starting with Phase 1 by modifying the `handleImageAttachments` method in `bot.ts` to remove the single image restriction and adding proper session management. This gives us a solid foundation to build upon for the more complex interactive features.
